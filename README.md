## Welcome to Game of Life!

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

### Rules 

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.


### How to play
To play this version you have to clone the repository in a folder of your choosing. After that open the solution file and run the project. Upon starting you have to type the name of the pattern you want to see. 



### Patterns
There are 3 common patterns know as:

- Still lifes
These patterns do not change from one generation to the next. Common patterns are the Block, Beehive, Tub and many others.

- Oscillators
After a finite number of generations these patterns return to their initial state. Popular ones are Blinker, Beacon and Toad. The listed ones have a period of 2 meaning that after two generations they return to the initial state.

- Spaceships
Flying across the grid these patterns return to their initial configuration after a different number of ticks. Common spaceships are Glider, Lightweight spaceships, Middleweight spaceships and Heavyweight spaceships.
